# Summary
In this module, you learned how to create an API by using the minimal API template for .NET 6.

Minimal API enables you to create an API with only a few lines of code. It has all the major features that you're used to like dependency injection, talking to databases, and route management. A minimal API differs from a controller-based API because you explicitly specify the routes you need instead of relying on a convention-based approach like with a controller-based API.

There are many benefits to this approach:

1. Easier to get started: With four lines of code, you can have an API up and running quickly.
2. Progressive enhancement: Add features when you need them. Until then, your program code stays small.
3. .NET 6 latest features: Use all the latest features from .NET 6 like top-level statements and records.
As part of this module, you learned how to add Swagger. You also added routes to create, read, update, and delete a resource.
